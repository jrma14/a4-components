I recreated my todo list from a2 using Svelte. All I changed is the html is now all in svelte, and some of the functions have been simplified because I no longer need to generate my own html as Svelte automatically does the updating. The way I setup my original a2 was a bit weird because of the requirements, so I had to adapt it to use Svelte, which is a little weird still, but it is way cleaner than before. If I had been using Svelte from the beginning it could be even cleaner yet.
